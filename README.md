# FlowPlot: flow diagrams and assessment tools

pip install flowplot

_user-inputs_ folder includes user-input examples of: 
- flow time series
- cycles 

Creates the following three diagrams for a user-determined cycle:
1. **Water circles**, showing the partitioned inputs, outputs, net storage changes, and balance, aggregated spatiotemporal;
2. **Line graphs, overall**, showing the inputs, outputs, net storage changes, and balance through time, aggregated spatially;
3. **Line graphs, partitioned**, showing the partitioned flows through time, aggregated spatially.
